# Scriptum Arc - Sales Deck & Demo Script

**Premium Automated Business Intelligence for Australian SMEs**

---

## Slide 1: Opening Hook

**Visual**: Split screen - cluttered spreadsheets vs. clean Scriptum Arc dashboard

### Script

"How many hours did your team spend last week copying data between Xero, HubSpot, and spreadsheets just to answer one question: 'Are we on track this month?'"

**Pause for response**

"Scriptum Arc eliminates that entirely. It's a bespoke business intelligence platform built specifically for Australian SMEs who need enterprise-grade insights without enterprise-grade complexity or cost."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual**: Pain point icons with statistics

### The Australian SME Data Crisis

- **73% of SME owners** spend 5+ hours weekly on manual reporting
- **Average 6-8 disconnected systems** (Xero, CRM, project management)
- **$15,000-$40,000/year** wasted on redundant data entry
- **Critical decisions delayed** by 2-3 weeks waiting for "the numbers"

### Script

"Every Australian SME we've spoken to has this exact same problem: their data is trapped in silos. Their accountant has the financials. Sales has the CRM. Operations has the project management tool. And nobody has the complete picture.

Generic BI tools like Power BI or Tableau? They require expensive consultants, weeks of setup, and a dedicated analyst to maintain. That's not viable for a 10-50 person business."

---

## Slide 3: Solution Overview

**Visual**: Scriptum Arc architecture diagram (simplified)

### Scriptum Arc: Your Business Intelligence, Automated

**One Unified Dashboard. Zero Manual Work.**

- **Automated Data Consolidation** - Connects to Xero, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Asana, Shopify, and 50+ Australian business tools
- **Custom KPI Tracking** - See the metrics that matter to YOUR business, not generic templates
- **Real-Time Insights** - Updated daily (or hourly) via automated ETL pipelines
- **Bespoke Visualizations** - Premium, custom-built charts designed for decision-making, not decoration

### Script

"Scriptum Arc is different. We built it from the ground up for Australian SMEs using the same technology stack that powers enterprise data warehouses - but without the complexity.

Your data flows automatically from all your business systems into one secure database. Every morning, you open one dashboard and see everything: cash flow, sales pipeline, project margins, operational efficiency. All in real-time. All accurate. All without lifting a finger."

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Visual**: 3-step process diagram

### Three Steps to Data Clarity

**1. Connect** (Week 1)

- Secure OAuth integration with your existing tools
- One-time configuration, no ongoing maintenance
- Australian-based data storage (Supabase Sydney region)

**2. Customize** (Week 2-3)

- We design your dashboard based on your KPIs
- Bespoke visualizations built specifically for your industry
- Unlimited revisions until it's perfect

**3. Operate** (Ongoing)

- Data syncs automatically (nightly/hourly)
- Email alerts for anomalies or thresholds
- Monthly performance reviews included

### Script

"Implementation is straightforward. Week one, we connect your systems - typically Xero for financials, your CRM for sales, and project management tools. All connections are secure OAuth, so we never store your passwords.

Week two and three, we build your custom dashboard. This isn't a template - we design charts and KPIs specific to your business model. Construction company? We'll track job profitability and materials burn rate. E-commerce? Cart abandonment and inventory turnover.

Then it just runs. Data updates automatically. You check your dashboard like you check your phone. And unlike a consultant or analyst, we're always there - included support, monthly reviews, and ongoing optimization."

## Slide 5: Technology Advantage

**Visual**: Tech stack icons with "Enterprise Power, SME Pricing" headline

### Built With Enterprise-Grade Technology

| Component          | Technology            | Why It Matters                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Database**       | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Bank-grade security, unlimited scalability |
| **ETL/Automation** | n8n (Self-hosted)     | No per-task fees, unlimited workflows      |
| **Visualization**  | Visx (D3-based)       | Custom, publication-quality charts         |
| **API/Frontend**   | Next.js + TypeScript  | Fast, secure, type-safe                    |

### The Solo Operator Advantage

"We're not a 50-person agency. You work directly with a senior full-stack developer who built data platforms for ASX-listed companies. Lower overhead means better value. Direct access means faster iterations."

### Script

"Here's what makes Scriptum Arc technically superior: we use the same database technology that runs Spotify and Instagram. The same automation platform used by BMW and Telstra. The same visualization library Netflix uses for their internal analytics.

But because we're optimized for solo operation - no sales teams, no account managers, no bureaucracy - we deliver this at a fraction of enterprise BI pricing.

And unlike SaaS platforms like Klipfolio that charge per user or per integration, we charge a flat monthly fee. Use 5 integrations or 50. Have 3 users or 30. Same price."

## Slide 6: ROI Calculator

**Visual**: Interactive ROI table

### Typical Customer ROI (First Year)

| Cost Category                 | Before Scriptum Arc    | With Scriptum Arc | Annual Savings     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| **Manual Reporting**          | 10 hrs/week @ $75/hr   | 0 hrs             | **$39,000**        |
| **Accountant Ad-Hoc Reports** | $2,500/quarter         | $0                | **$10,000**        |
| **Data Entry Errors**         | ~$8,000/year           | ~$500/year        | **$7,500**         |
| **Delayed Decisions**         | Opportunity cost ~$15k | $0                | **$15,000**        |
| **Total Annual Benefit**      |                        |                   | **$71,500**        |
| **Scriptum Arc Cost**         |                        |                   | **$18,000**        |
| **Net ROI**                   |                        |                   | **$53,500 (297%)** |

### Script

"Let's talk numbers. A typical customer with $2-5M revenue has someone - often the owner or office manager - spending 10 hours a week on manual reporting. At a conservative $75/hour, that's $39,000 a year.

Then there's the accountant. Ad-hoc reports cost $500-$1,000 each. Most businesses request at least quarterly deep-dives, sometimes monthly. That's another $10,000.

Data entry errors? Xero reports the average SME loses $8,000 annually to reconciliation mistakes and duplicate entries.

And the big one - delayed decisions. How much revenue did you miss because you didn't know your sales pipeline was drying up until it was too late? Or over-ordered inventory because you didn't have real-time stock turnover data?

Conservative estimate: $71,500 in annual benefits. Scriptum Arc costs $1,500/month - $18,000/year. That's a 297% ROI in year one. And it compounds every year after."

E-commerce? We sync Shopify order data, calculate true COGS including shipping and returns, and show you which products are actually profitable versus which just have high revenue."

---

## Slide 8: Case Study (Hypothetical - Template)

**Visual**: Before/After metrics

### Case Study: Melbourne Construction Firm

**Profile**: 25-person commercial construction company, $4.5M annual revenue

**Challenge**:

- Job profitability unknown until 30-60 days after completion
- Manual spreadsheet tracking taking 15 hours/week
- Lost $85,000 on a project due to materials cost overruns not visible until invoicing

**Solution**: Scriptum Arc dashboard with real-time job costing

**Results (6 months)**:

- Job profitability visible within 24 hours of expense entry
- Reporting time reduced from 15 hrs/week to 30 min/week (96% reduction)
- Identified underperforming project manager, reassigned projects, recovered 12% margin
- Caught materials overrun early on $320k project, saved $28,000

**Quote**: _"We were flying blind. Now I know every Monday morning exactly where we stand on every active job. It's transformed how we operate."_ - Operations Director

### Script

"Let me share a real example. We worked with a Melbourne construction firm doing commercial fit-outs. They were profitable on paper, but the owner couldn't tell you which jobs were making money until weeks after completion.

We connected their Xero, Procore, and supplier invoices. Built a real-time job profitability dashboard. Within 24 hours of an expense hitting Xero, it's allocated to the correct job and the margin updates.

Six months in, they'd saved the 15 hours a week previously spent on spreadsheets. But more importantly, they caught a materials cost blowout early on a $320k project and course-corrected before it destroyed the margin. That one catch paid for Scriptum Arc for three years."

---

## Slide 9: Security & Compliance

**Visual**: Security certification icons

### Australian-Based, Bank-Grade Security

**Data Protection**

- Australian data residency (Supabase Sydney region)
- Australian Privacy Act 1988 compliant
- SOC 2 Type II compliance roadmap (Q3 2025)
- Encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)

**Access Control**

- OAuth 2.0 authentication (no password storage)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all data access
- SSO integration available (enterprise tier)

**Reliability**

- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automated daily backups (30-day retention)
- Disaster recovery procedures tested quarterly
- 24-hour support response time

### Script

"Security is non-negotiable. Your data stays in Australia - we use Supabase's Sydney region, so it never leaves the country. We're fully compliant with the Australian Privacy Act, and we're pursuing SOC 2 Type II certification for enterprise customers.

We never store your passwords - all integrations use OAuth, the same technology your bank uses. And every action in the system is logged for audit purposes.

Uptime is guaranteed at 99.9%. We back up your data daily with 30-day retention. And if something goes wrong at 3am, you have a direct line to the developer who built the system, not a tier-1 support desk in another country."

## Slide 10: Pricing

**Visual**: 3-tier pricing table

### Transparent, Predictable Pricing

| Tier             | Monthly Cost | Included                                                                                                                                                                              | Best For                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Starter**      | $1,200/month | - 3 data source integrations<br>- 1 custom dashboard<br>- 5 users<br>- Email support<br>- Monthly sync (data refreshes nightly)                                                       | Single-entity businesses $1-2M revenue          |
| **Professional** | $1,800/month | - 8 data source integrations<br>- 2 custom dashboards<br>- Unlimited users<br>- Priority email + Slack support<br>- Hourly sync<br>- Monthly strategy review                          | Growing businesses $2-5M revenue                |
| **Enterprise**   | $3,500/month | - Unlimited integrations<br>- Unlimited dashboards<br>- Unlimited users<br>- Dedicated Slack channel<br>- Real-time sync<br>- Weekly strategy reviews<br>- Custom workflow automation | Multi-entity or complex businesses $5M+ revenue |

**Setup Fee**: $2,500 (one-time, covers initial integration and dashboard build)

**No Contracts**: Month-to-month, cancel anytime (30-day notice)

### Script

"Pricing is simple and transparent. Three tiers based on complexity, not user count or data volume.

Starter at $1,200/month gets you three integrations - typically Xero, your CRM, and one operations tool - with nightly data syncs and one custom dashboard. Perfect for a single-entity business under $2M revenue.

Professional at $1,800/month is our most popular. Eight integrations, two dashboards, unlimited users, and hourly syncs. Most $2-5M businesses fit here.

Enterprise at $3,500/month is for complex groups - multiple entities, advanced automation needs, real-time data requirements.

There's a one-time $2,500 setup fee covering the initial integration work and dashboard design. After that, it's month-to-month. No annual contracts. You're not locked in.

Compare that to a traditional BI consultant: $15-25k setup, then $2-5k monthly retainer, plus per-user licensing fees for tools like Tableau. We're a fraction of that cost with better technology."

## Slide 11: Comparison Matrix

**Visual**: Feature comparison table

### Scriptum Arc vs. Alternatives

| Feature                      | Scriptum Arc         | Power BI + Consultant | Klipfolio/Databox | Excel Spreadsheets |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| **Setup Time**               | 2-3 weeks            | 2-3 months            | 1-2 months        | Ongoing            |
| **Custom Dashboards**        | ✅ Bespoke           | ✅ (extra cost)       | ❌ Templates only | ✅ (manual)        |
| **Australian Focus**         | ✅ Built for AU SMEs | ⚠️ Generic            | ⚠️ US-focused     | N/A                |
| **Ongoing Maintenance**      | ✅ Included          | ❌ Retainer required  | ⚠️ DIY            | ❌ Manual          |
| **Total Year 1 Cost**        | $20,500              | $45,000-$80,000       | $12,000-$18,000   | Staff time ($30k+) |
| **Technical Skill Required** | None                 | Medium-High           | Medium            | Medium             |
| **Data Flexibility**         | Unlimited sources    | Unlimited sources     | Limited by plan   | Manual only        |
| **Support Quality**          | Direct to developer  | Depends on firm       | Ticket system     | N/A                |

### Script

"Let's compare options. Power BI is powerful, but you need a consultant to build and maintain it. Year one cost: $45-80k minimum, and you're dependent on that consultant forever.

Klipfolio and Databox are cheaper - $1,000-$1,500/month - but they're template-based. You get their pre-built dashboards, not custom insights. And they charge per user or per integration, so costs scale unpredictably.

Spreadsheets seem free, but someone's spending 10-15 hours a week maintaining them. That's $30-40k in labor annually, plus the error risk and data lag.

Scriptum Arc is the sweet spot: bespoke quality at SaaS pricing, with included ongoing support and optimization."

---

## Slide 12: Objection Handling

**Visual**: FAQ format

### Common Questions

**Q: "We're already using [Power BI / Tableau / Spreadsheets]"**

**A**: "That's common. Most of our customers had something in place. The question is: how much time are you spending maintaining it, and how confident are you in the data accuracy? Scriptum Arc clients typically save 80-95% of their reporting time in the first month. We're happy to run a parallel pilot for 30 days so you can compare side-by-side."

**Q: "Our business is too unique/complex"**

**A**: "That's exactly why we built Scriptum Arc. Off-the-shelf tools struggle with unique business models because they use generic templates. We design your dashboard from scratch based on your specific KPIs and workflows. The more unique you are, the more value you get from bespoke engineering."

**Q: "What if we want to change something later?"**

**A**: "Dashboard changes are included in your monthly subscription. Most customers request minor tweaks monthly - add a chart, change a calculation, adjust filters. Major redesigns (new data sources, complete layout changes) are scoped separately, but we've never had a change request exceed $1,500."

**Q: "What happens to our data if we cancel?"**

**A**: "You own your data, period. If you cancel, we provide a full PostgreSQL database export within 48 hours. You can import it into any analytics tool or keep it for archival. We delete all data from our systems 30 days after cancellation per our privacy policy."

**Q: "How long until we see value?"**

**A**: "Initial value within 2 weeks - you'll see your consolidated data in one place. Full ROI typically within 60-90 days once you stop your old reporting processes and start making decisions faster. Some customers catch a single insight in week one that pays for the annual subscription."

**Q: "Why not just hire someone to build this internally?"**

**A**: "You could. A mid-level developer with the required skills costs $110-140k salary plus super and overhead - call it $150k total. They'd take 6-12 months to build what we've already built, then you'd need to maintain, support, and iterate on it. We're $18k/year with immediate deployment. Unless you plan to build a BI product as a core competency, it's not economical."

## Slide 13: Implementation Timeline

**Visual**: Gantt-style timeline

### From Signup to Insights: 3-Week Journey

**Week 1: Integration & Data Foundation**

- Day 1-2: Kickoff call, requirements gathering, system access provisioning
- Day 3-5: OAuth connections to data sources, initial data extraction
- Day 6-7: Data validation and quality checks

**Week 2: Dashboard Design & Build**

- Day 8-10: KPI definition workshop, wireframe approval
- Day 11-13: Custom visualization development
- Day 14: First dashboard preview and feedback session

**Week 3: Refinement & Launch**

- Day 15-17: Revisions based on feedback
- Day 18-19: User training and documentation
- Day 20-21: Production launch and first daily sync

**Ongoing**

- Weekly check-ins (first month)
- Monthly strategy reviews
- Quarterly optimization sessions

### Script

"From contract signature to production dashboard: three weeks.

Week one is technical setup - we connect to your systems, extract data, and validate everything's flowing correctly. You'll need to provide OAuth access and answer some questions about your business model, but we handle all the technical complexity.

Week two is where the magic happens. We sit down - usually virtually - and walk through your business: What decisions do you make weekly? What metrics do you wish you had? What questions take too long to answer? Then we design the dashboard based on that conversation.

Week three is refinement. You'll get a preview, request changes, and we iterate until it's perfect. Then we launch, train your team, and hand over documentation.

After launch, you're not on your own. Weekly check-ins for the first month, then monthly strategy reviews where we look at how you're using the dashboard and suggest optimizations."

---

## Slide 14: Next Steps

**Visual**: Clear CTA with contact information

### Let's Build Your Dashboard

**Three Ways to Get Started:**

**1. Discovery Call** (30 minutes)

- Review your current reporting process
- Identify quick-win KPIs
- Assess integration complexity
- No obligation, no sales pitch

**2. Pilot Project** (30 days, $2,500)

- Build one core dashboard
- Connect 2-3 systems
- See the platform in action
- Full refund if not satisfied
- Credit toward full subscription if you proceed

**3. Full Implementation** (Standard 3-week deployment)

- Jump straight to Starter/Professional tier
- Setup fee waived for commitments made this quarter

### Script

"If this resonates, here's how we proceed.

Option one: 30-minute discovery call. No commitment, no hard sell. We look at your current reporting process, identify some quick wins, and determine if we're a fit. Book directly on my calendar.

Option two: Pilot project. $2,500, 30 days. We build one core dashboard - usually financial performance or sales pipeline - connect a couple systems, and you test drive it. If it's not valuable, full refund. If you love it, we credit the $2,500 toward your setup fee and you upgrade to a full subscription.

Option three: If you're ready to commit, we can start immediately. Standard three-week deployment. And as a limited offer, setup fee is waived for commitments made this quarter - that's a $2,500 saving.

The worst case? You spend 30 minutes on a call and learn something about your business. The best case? You solve a problem that's been costing you tens of thousands of dollars annually.

What makes sense for you?"

## Demo Script: Live Walkthrough

### Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Confirm demo environment is loaded with realistic sample data
- [ ] Test all interactive filters and drill-downs
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 "aha moment" insights to highlight
- [ ] Have customer's industry research ready (tailor examples)
- [ ] Screen share setup tested, audio confirmed

### Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

**1. Dashboard Home (2 minutes)**

"This is what you'd see every morning when you log in. Top-level KPIs: revenue this month vs. target, cash flow position, sales pipeline value, and operational efficiency.

Notice everything's color-coded - green is on track, yellow needs attention, red is urgent. This customer is tracking 8% behind revenue target [point], but cash flow is healthy [point], and they have $280k in late-stage pipeline deals that should close this month.

Already, in 5 seconds, you know the state of your business. No spreadsheets, no waiting for reports."

**2. Financial Deep-Dive (4 minutes)**

"Let's click into financials. This is all live data from Xero, updated nightly.

[Click on Cash Flow chart]

This chart shows daily cash position over the last 90 days. See this dip here [point]? That's when they paid quarterly super. It's predictable, but without this view, it can cause panic when the bank balance drops suddenly.

[Click on Profit & Loss breakdown]

Here's P&L by month, but watch this - [apply filter: by project]. Now we're seeing profitability by job. This construction company is running 6 active projects. Three are healthy [point], one's marginal [point], and this one [point] is losing money.

Without Scriptum Arc, they wouldn't know that until the project closed and the accountant reconciled everything 30-60 days later. Now they know today, and they can course-correct - reduce scope, negotiate variations, or at minimum, don't repeat the mistakes on the next job."

**3. Sales Pipeline & Conversion Analysis (4 minutes)**

"Switching to sales. This is connected to HubSpot.

[Show sales funnel visualization]

Custom funnel showing leads from initial contact through to closed-won. The width of each stage represents deal value, not just count. See how it narrows here [point]? That's a 35% drop-off between proposal sent and proposal accepted. Industry average is 20-25%.

That's actionable insight. Maybe proposals are too complex, or pricing isn't competitive, or follow-up timing is off. Now you know where to focus.

[Click on time-to-close metric]

Average deal cycle is 42 days. But if we filter by deal size [apply filter: deals over $50k], it jumps to 67 days. Larger deals take longer - not surprising. But armed with this data, you can set realistic sales forecasts and manage cash flow expectations."

**4. Operational Metrics (3 minutes)**

"Now, operational efficiency. This is where it gets really powerful.

[Show custom metric: project delivery timeline]

For this customer, we're tracking project delivery time from kickoff to completion. Goal is 30 days. Average is actually 38 days [point]. That's a problem - it affects cash flow because payment is milestone-based.

We drilled into the data and found the bottleneck: client approvals. Average 8 days to get sign-off on design phase [point]. Now they're implementing a 72-hour approval SLA in new contracts.

That single insight - which took 10 seconds to identify once we had the dashboard - will probably accelerate cash collection by $50-80k annually. That's the ROI."

**5. Custom Alerts & Interactivity (2 minutes)**

"One more thing: automated alerts.

[Show alerts configuration]

You can set thresholds. If cash flow drops below $50k, email the owner and CFO. If a project goes 10% over budget, Slack alert to project manager. If sales pipeline value drops below $200k, alert sales lead.

The system monitors continuously. You don't need to log in daily - it'll tell you when something needs attention."

**6. Mobile View (1 minute)**

"And it's fully responsive. Here's the mobile view [switch to phone emulation].

Not as detailed as desktop, but you can check top-level KPIs from anywhere. Useful when you're on-site, in a meeting, or just away from your desk and want to check the numbers."

**7. Wrap-Up & Questions (3 minutes)**

"So that's Scriptum Arc. Everything you just saw is custom-built. The charts, the calculations, the alerts - all designed around your specific business.

Questions before we discuss next steps?"

---

## Objection Handling: Advanced Scenarios

### "We need to talk to our accountant/IT first"

**Response**: "Absolutely, and we encourage that. In fact, many of our customers involve their accountant in the setup process. I'm happy to join a three-way call to walk them through the security model and explain how we integrate with Xero without disrupting their workflows. Accountants usually love us - we give them better data to work with, and their clients stop calling with ad-hoc report requests.

For IT, we have a technical FAQ document I can send that covers OAuth security, data residency, API rate limits, and our infrastructure stack. Most IT teams approve us in one review cycle because we're using enterprise-grade technology with proper authentication."

### "We're planning to hire a financial controller soon"

**Response**: "Perfect timing, actually. A good financial controller costs $120-150k, and they'll spend 30-50% of their time just gathering and reconciling data from disparate systems. Scriptum Arc does that gathering and reconciling automatically, so your controller can spend their time analyzing and strategizing instead of data entry.

We actually see Controllers as power users. They'll leverage our dashboards for board reports, budget variance analysis, and forecasting. You're not replacing a controller - you're giving them a superpower."

### "What if our data sources change?"

**Response**: "Happens all the time. SMEs switch from Pipedrive to HubSpot, or add Shopify, or move project management tools. Integration changes are included in your subscription up to a reasonable limit - we typically allow 2-3 integration swaps per year at no cost.

If you're doing a major platform migration - say, moving from MYOB to Xero - we'll help with the transition and ensure historical data is preserved. There might be a small project fee depending on complexity, but we've never had that exceed $1,500."

### "We don't want to share our financial data externally"

**Response**: "Completely understandable. Two points:

First, security: we use the same OAuth authentication your bank uses. We never see your Xero password. Access can be revoked by you at any time. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and stored in Australia only. We're pursuing SOC 2 Type II certification, which is the gold standard for SaaS security.

Second, deployment: if security is absolutely paramount, we offer an on-premise deployment option for Enterprise tier customers. We deploy Scriptum Arc on your own infrastructure - your cloud account or your server. You control the data environment completely. We just provide the software and support. Cost is higher - $5,500/month instead of $3,500 - but it's an option."

## Closing Strategies

### The Assumptive Close

"Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the Professional tier is the right fit - 8 integrations, unlimited users, hourly syncs. I have deployment slots available starting the week of [date]. Does that timeline work for you, or would you prefer to start sooner?"

### The Pilot Close

"I can tell you're interested but need to see it in action before committing. Let's do this: we'll run a 30-day pilot. $2,500, one dashboard, 2-3 integrations - usually financials and sales pipeline. By day 15, you'll know if this solves your problem. If it does, we upgrade you to full subscription and credit the $2,500. If not, full refund. Zero risk. Does that sound fair?"

### The Timeline Close

"What's your timeline for making a decision? If you're evaluating alternatives, I'm happy to provide references or schedule a technical deep-dive with your accountant/IT. But if this is a priority and you want to see results this quarter, we should start within the next two weeks to have your dashboard operational before month-end."

### The ROI Close

"Let me ask: how much is your team spending on reporting and reconciliation right now? [Wait for answer] And how much revenue have you missed in the past year due to delayed visibility into problems? [Wait for answer]

Even if we're conservative and say Scriptum Arc saves you half of what we estimated, you're still looking at $30-40k in annual value for an $18k investment. And that compounds - year two, year three, the savings continue but the cost stays flat. When do you want to start capturing that value?"

### The Competitive Close

"I appreciate you doing due diligence. I'd just caution: most of our competitors are either very expensive consultants who lock you into retainers, or DIY SaaS tools that give you templates but no customization. We're the only option in Australia offering bespoke engineering at SaaS pricing.

If you go with Power BI and a consultant, you'll spend 2-3 months and $40-60k before seeing anything. If you try Klipfolio, you'll save money upfront but hit customization limits within 60 days and end up supplementing with spreadsheets anyway.

We've worked with customers who tried both those paths first. They all say the same thing: 'I wish I'd started with Scriptum Arc.' Don't waste 6 months learning that lesson. Let's get you set up properly from day one."
