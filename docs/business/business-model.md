## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**API Changes from Vendors** (Xero, HubSpot, etc.):

- Risk: Third-party APIs change, breaking integrations
- Mitigation: Monitor vendor API announcements, have update process
- Mitigation: Build abstraction layer so changes isolated to one place
- Mitigation: Test integrations regularly with automated health checks

**Data Synchronization Issues**:

- Risk: Data gets out of sync between systems, causing confusion
- Mitigation: Clear error logging and alerting
- Mitigation: Automated health checks and reconciliation
- Mitigation: Manual override and correction procedures documented

### Business Risks

**Client Technical Literacy**:

- Risk: Clients intimidated by technology, resist automation
- Mitigation: Heavy focus on business outcomes, not technology
- Mitigation: Comprehensive training and handholding
- Mitigation: Ongoing support to build confidence

**Market Education**:

- Risk: SMEs don't know automation is possible or affordable
- Mitigation: Educational content marketing (case studies, workshops)
- Mitigation: ROI calculators and clear pricing
- Mitigation: "Quick win" starter packages to prove value

**Vendor Dependency**:

- Risk: Reliant on third-party platforms (Xero, HubSpot)
- Mitigation: Support multiple alternatives (MYOB, Pipedrive, Salesforce)
- Mitigation: Clear communication to clients about platform choices
- Mitigation: Build transferable workflows, not locked-in solutions

**Scaling Challenges**:

- Risk: Limited team capacity as client base grows
- Mitigation: Standardized workflow templates reduce implementation time
- Mitigation: Client self-service capabilities for simple changes
- Mitigation: Strategic hiring plan (contractor consultants initially)
