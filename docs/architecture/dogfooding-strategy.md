### Tool Integration Strategy

**n8n as Central Hub:**

- Connects all tools via APIs and webhooks
- Automates data flow between systems
- Provides custom business logic
- Handles error handling and retry logic

**Data Flow Pattern:**

```
Client Action → n8n Workflow → Tool Integration → Database Update → Dashboard Refresh
```

**Integration Examples:**

1. **Client Onboarding**: New client → n8n → Plane project + Nextcloud folder + Mautic email
2. **Time Tracking**: Consultant logs hours → n8n → Financial records + Invoice Ninja
3. **Support**: Client ticket → n8n → Plane task + Team notification + Metrics tracking

### Next.js vs SME Tools: Responsibility Clarification

**Next.js Application (Unified BI Layer):**

- Real-time, interactive dashboards aggregating data from all SME tools
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Multi-tenant user authentication and authorization
- Advanced analytics, ML models, and predictive insights
- Mobile application with offline sync
- Custom KPI tracking across all business operations

**SME Tools (Domain-Specific Operations):**

- **Plane**: Project management tasks, issues, sprints (data source for project metrics)
- **Invoice Ninja**: Invoice generation, payment tracking (data source for financial metrics)
- **Metabase**: Static analytics dashboards for ad-hoc SQL queries
- **Chatwoot**: Client support tickets and communication
- **Mautic**: Marketing campaigns and lead nurturing
- **Nextcloud**: File storage and document management

**Data Flow**: SME Tools → n8n ETL → PostgreSQL → Next.js BI Dashboard
