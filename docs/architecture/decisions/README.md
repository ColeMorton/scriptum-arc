# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made during the development of Zixly.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing or have made?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Business Context

**Zixly is a DevOps automation platform for Brisbane businesses.**

This platform:

- Provides webhook-triggered data analysis pipelines
- Demonstrates cloud-native infrastructure patterns
- Showcases Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS expertise
- Is open-source for portfolio demonstration and reuse purposes

## Decision Categories

### Architecture Decisions

- **Multi-tenant vs Single-tenant**: Internal operations platform
- **Pipeline orchestration**: Kubernetes Jobs vs other orchestration tools
- **Event architecture**: Webhook-driven vs polling-based pipelines
- **Local-first strategy**: Docker Compose MVP before cloud deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform with LocalStack for local development
- **Real-time data strategy**: WebSocket vs polling approaches
- **Mobile app architecture**: React Native vs native development

### Technology Decisions

- **Database choice**: PostgreSQL with Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth vs custom solution
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose → Kubernetes → AWS EKS progression
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana observability stack
- **Queue System**: Redis/Bull vs AWS SQS for job processing
- **Infrastructure**: LocalStack for local AWS emulation

### Business Decisions

- **Open-source strategy**: Community engagement and contribution
- **Internal operations focus**: Service business optimization
- **Dogfooding approach**: Authentic expertise demonstration
- **Competitive positioning**: Unique market differentiation

## Decision Process

### 1. Identify Decision Need

- Architecture review identifies decision points
- Business requirements drive technology choices
- Implementation challenges require solutions
- Performance or security concerns arise

### 2. Research Options

- Evaluate multiple approaches
- Consider trade-offs and consequences
- Research best practices and patterns
- Consult with team and stakeholders

### 3. Make Decision

- Document rationale and context
- Record decision and consequences
- Communicate to team
- Update implementation plans

### 4. Review and Update

- Regular review of decisions
- Update when context changes
- Deprecate when superseded
- Learn from consequences

## Decision Principles

### Technical Principles

- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, elegant solutions
- **Maintainability**: Choose maintainable approaches
- **Performance**: Optimize for performance
- **Security**: Prioritize security and compliance

### Business Principles

- **DevOps Automation**: Focus on Brisbane tech market
- **Open-Source**: Enable portfolio demonstration and reuse
- **Cloud-Native Patterns**: Demonstrate modern infrastructure practices
- **Competitive Advantage**: Local Brisbane DevOps expertise

### Implementation Principles

- **Fail-Fast**: Throw meaningful exceptions immediately
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode across entire stack
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Enforce tenant_id scoping in all queries
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all decisions
