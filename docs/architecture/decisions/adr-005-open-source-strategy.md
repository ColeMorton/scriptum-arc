# ADR-005: Open-Source Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Deciders**: Business Architecture Team

## Context

Zixly is an open-source internal operations platform for the Zixly service business. We need to decide on the open-source strategy for community engagement, code sharing, and business development.

**Business Context**:

- Zixly is a service business that provides n8n automation services to clients
- This platform tracks Zixly's internal service delivery operations
- Demonstrates "eating our own dogfood" with self-hostable SME stack
- Open-source for demonstration and reuse purposes

**Strategic Objectives**:

- Authentic expertise demonstration
- Community contribution and engagement
- Business development and client trust
- Market education about self-hostable benefits

## Decision

**Open-Source Strategy**: Release codebase on GitHub with comprehensive documentation and community engagement

**Rationale**:

- Transparency builds client trust
- Community contribution drives innovation
- Demonstration value for potential clients
- Competitive advantage through authenticity
- Market education about self-hostable benefits

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Client trust and credibility
- Community contribution and feedback
- Demonstration value for business development
- Competitive differentiation
- Market education and awareness
- Authentic expertise proof

**Negative**:

- Increased development overhead
- Community management requirements
- Potential security concerns
- Competitive intelligence exposure
- Documentation maintenance burden

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Internal Operations (Current)

- Use platform internally to run Zixly business
- Build authentic expertise and workflows
- Create case studies and success stories
- Document internal operations patterns

### Phase 2: Open-Source Release (Future)

- Release codebase on GitHub
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Provide community contribution guidelines
- Share architecture patterns for reuse

### Phase 3: Community Engagement (Future)

- Engage with n8n and SME automation communities
- Contribute to related open-source projects
- Share knowledge through content and talks
- Build relationships with potential clients
