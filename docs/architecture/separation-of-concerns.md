# n8n vs Web App Separation of Concerns

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-15  
**Owner**: Technical Architecture  
**Status**: Defined

---

## Overview

This document defines the clear boundaries between n8n (workflow automation platform) and Zixly's web application (business intelligence platform). The separation ensures zero duplication, leverages each platform's strengths, and creates a complementary architecture that scales efficiently.

---

## Core Principle: Complementary Architecture

**Philosophy**: Each platform does what it does best, with zero overlap in responsibilities.

- **n8n**: Workflow automation, data movement, API integrations
- **Web App**: Business intelligence, user experience, real-time communication, analytics

## Data Flow Architecture

### Clear Data Flow Patterns

**n8n → PostgreSQL (Write Operations):**

```
External APIs → n8n Workflows → Data Transformation → PostgreSQL
```

**PostgreSQL → Web App (Read Operations):**

```
PostgreSQL → Web App API → Business Intelligence UI → User
```

**Real-Time Updates:**

```
n8n Workflow Completion → PostgreSQL Update → Supabase Real-time → WebSocket → UI Update
```

### Integration Points

**Single Integration Point:**

- **PostgreSQL Database**: The only shared resource between n8n and web app
- **n8n writes**: Processed business data, workflow metadata, sync status
- **Web app reads**: Business data for presentation, metadata for UI, status for indicators

**No Direct Communication:**

- ❌ Web app NEVER calls n8n APIs directly
- ❌ n8n NEVER calls web app APIs directly
- ❌ No workflow execution from web app
- ❌ No data transformation in web app

---

## API Boundaries

### Web App API Endpoints (Read-Only)

**Business Intelligence APIs:**

```typescript
GET / api / dashboards // Read aggregated business data
GET / api / kpis // Read KPI metrics and trends
GET / api / analytics // Read analytics and insights
GET / api / reports // Read business reports
```

**Data Status APIs:**

```typescript
GET / api / sync - status // Read data freshness indicators
GET / api / workflow - status // Read workflow metadata (UI only)
GET / api / data - sources // Read integration status
```

**Real-Time APIs:**

```typescript
WebSocket / api / notifications // Real-time updates and alerts
WebSocket / api / dashboard // Live dashboard data
```

### What Web App APIs NEVER Include

**Workflow Management (n8n handles):**

- ❌ POST /api/workflows/execute
- ❌ POST /api/workflows/schedule
- ❌ PUT /api/workflows/configure
- ❌ DELETE /api/workflows/delete

**Integration Management (n8n handles):**

- ❌ POST /api/integrations/connect
- ❌ PUT /api/integrations/configure
- ❌ POST /api/integrations/sync
- ❌ DELETE /api/integrations/disconnect

**Data Transformation (n8n handles):**

- ❌ POST /api/data/transform
- ❌ POST /api/data/process
- ❌ POST /api/etl/execute

## Database Schema Boundaries

### Tables n8n Writes To

**Business Data (n8n workflows write, web app reads):**

```prisma
model Financial {
  // n8n workflows write financial data
  // Web app reads for dashboards
}

model LeadEvent {
  // n8n workflows write CRM data
  // Web app reads for sales analytics
}

model CustomMetric {
  // n8n workflows write KPI data
  // Web app reads for business intelligence
}
```

**Workflow Metadata (UI display only):**

```prisma
model WorkflowMetadata {
  // n8n writes workflow info for UI display
  // Web app reads for workflow status indicators
}

model DataSyncStatus {
  // n8n writes sync status for UI indicators
  // Web app reads for data freshness display
}
```

### Tables Web App Writes To

**User Management (web app writes, n8n never touches):**

```prisma
model User {
  // Web app manages user authentication
  // n8n never accesses user data
}

model Tenant {
  // Web app manages tenant configuration
  // n8n uses tenant_id for data isolation only
}
```
