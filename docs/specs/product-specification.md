# Zixly: Product Specification

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: MVP Definition

---

## Product Identity

**Name**: Zixly
**Category**: Automated Business Intelligence (ABI) Console
**Target Market**: Small-to-Medium Australian Businesses ($1-10M annual revenue)

**Product Definition**: A bespoke data consolidation and visualization platform that eliminates 5-15 hours per week of manual reporting by unifying data from 50+ business systems (Xero, HubSpot, Asana, Shopify, etc.) into real-time, custom-built dashboards.

---

## Value Proposition

### Core Promise

**"Bespoke Business Intelligence at SaaS Pricing"**

Zixly delivers enterprise-grade, custom-built data dashboards at predictable SaaS subscription rates—eliminating the traditional trade-off between generic template solutions (Power BI, Tableau) and expensive bespoke consulting engagements.

### Target Customer Profile

**Primary Personas** (See [Product Requirements Document](../product/product-requirements-document.md) for detailed personas):

- **Sarah** - SME Owner (Construction, Professional Services, E-commerce)
- **David** - External Accountant/Bookkeeper
- **James** - Operations Manager/COO

**Revenue Range**: $1M - $10M annual revenue
**Industry Focus**: Construction, Professional Services, E-commerce
**Geographic Focus**: Australia (data residency, compliance, local integrations)

**Pain Points Addressed**:

1. Manual data consolidation across disconnected systems (Xero + HubSpot + project management tools)
2. Delayed business insights (weekly/monthly reporting cycles instead of real-time)
3. Generic BI templates that don't match unique business workflows
4. Expensive custom consulting (AU$50K+ for bespoke dashboards)

## Strategic Objectives

### Solo-Operator Optimization

**Architectural Decision Drivers** (See [System Architecture](../architecture/system-architecture.md)):

The entire product architecture is explicitly designed to maximize developer velocity for a solo senior full-stack operator:

1. **Unified TypeScript ecosystem** - Eliminates context switching (Next.js frontend + API, Prisma type-safe ORM, n8n JavaScript nodes)
2. **Managed services** - Zero DevOps overhead (Vercel hosting, Supabase managed PostgreSQL, n8n Docker orchestration)
3. **Premium deliverable** - Visx custom visualizations justify premium pricing, avoiding commoditized template competition
4. **Automation-first** - n8n workflows automate ETL, reducing per-customer manual configuration

### Market Positioning

**Primary Go-To-Market Strategy** (Per [Sales Deck](../sales/sales-deck-demo-script.md)):

1. **Target acquisition**: Australian accounting firms (David persona - gateway to 10-50 SME clients)
2. **Sales approach**: 30-day pilot at $2,500 (credited if convert), demonstrating ROI with real customer data
3. **Conversion hook**: ROI calculator showing 297% Year 1 return (time savings + better decision-making)
4. **Retention**: Flat-rate pricing eliminates "per-user" growth penalties, incentivizes dashboard expansion
