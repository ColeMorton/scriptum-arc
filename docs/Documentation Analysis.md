  Priority Recommendations for Immediate Development

  Given you're in Phase 1 and operating as a solo developer with premium positioning, I recommend prioritizing these documents:

  High Priority (Before Phase 2)

  1. Product Requirements Document - Define exact feature scope to avoid scope creep
  2. Design System & Wireframes - Essential before Phase 3 visualization work
  3. API Documentation - Critical for Phase 1 completion and future integrations
  4. Security Architecture - Must define before handling customer data
  5. Data Governance Policy - Australian Privacy Act compliance is non-negotiable

  Medium Priority (Before MVP Launch)

  6. Terms of Service & Privacy Policy
  7. SLA Document
  8. Onboarding Documentation
  9. Support Runbook
  10. Financial Projections

  Post-MVP Priority

  11. Case Studies
  12. GTM Strategy (refined based on beta feedback)
  13. SOC 2 Compliance (if targeting enterprise)
