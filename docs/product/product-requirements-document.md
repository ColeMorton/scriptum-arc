## Executive Summary

### Product Overview

**Scriptum Arc** is a bespoke Business Intelligence platform designed specifically for Australian SMEs (Small-to-Medium Enterprises) with $1-10M annual revenue. The platform consolidates data from disconnected business systems (accounting, CRM, project management, e-commerce) into unified, real-time dashboards, eliminating manual reporting and enabling data-driven decision-making.

### Problem Statement

Australian SME owners and managers spend 5-15 hours weekly on manual reporting, copying data between systems, and reconciling spreadsheets. Critical business decisions are delayed by 2-3 weeks due to lack of timely, consolidated data. Existing BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) require expensive consultants and ongoing maintenance, making them economically unviable for businesses under $10M revenue.

### Solution

Scriptum Arc provides:
- **Automated Data Consolidation**: Nightly (or hourly) syncs from 50+ business systems via OAuth integrations
- **Bespoke Dashboards**: Custom-designed visualizations tailored to each customer's industry and KPIs
- **Zero Maintenance**: Fully managed platform with included support and ongoing optimization
- **Australian-Focused**: AU data residency, Privacy Act compliance, integrations with AU-specific tools (Xero, MYOB, Employment Hero)

### Target Customers

**Primary**: SME Business Owners & COOs
- Revenue: $2-5M annually
- Employees: 10-50
- Industries: Professional services, construction/trades, e-commerce, manufacturing
- Pain: Lack of real-time visibility into business performance

**Secondary**: Accountants & Bookkeepers
- Use Case: Validate client data accuracy, prepare board reports, provide advisory services
- Pain: Clients request ad-hoc reports that require manual data extraction

### Business Goals

1. **Year 1**: Achieve 18 customers, $241K revenue, operational breakeven by Month 10
2. **Year 2**: Grow to 42 customers, $654K revenue, 43% EBITDA margin
3. **Year 3**: Reach 78 customers, $1.24M revenue, establish market leadership in AU SME BI
4. **Long-term**: Build defensible moat through proprietary industry templates and customer lock-in via integrated workflows

**Description**: Visual representation of sales stages from lead to closed deal, with conversion rates.

**User Value**: Identifies bottlenecks in sales process, improves forecasting accuracy.

**Components**:

1. **Funnel Visualization** (Visx Custom Shape)
   - Stages: Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won
   - Each stage shows: count, total value (AUD), conversion rate to next stage
   - Width proportional to value (wider = more $)
   - Color gradient: Blue (top) → Green (bottom)

2. **Conversion Metrics Table**
   - Stage-by-stage breakdown
   - Metrics: Deals entered, Deals progressed, Conversion %, Avg time in stage
   - Highlight low-conversion stages (red <50%, yellow 50-70%, green >70%)

3. **Deal List** (Drill-Down)
   - Click on funnel stage to see all deals in that stage
   - Columns: Deal name, Value, Contact, Last activity, Days in stage
   - Sortable by column
   - Link to CRM (HubSpot) for full deal details

**Data Source**: `lead_events` table (HubSpot sync)

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/leads?stage=X&startDate=Y&endDate=Z`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Funnel chart displays correctly with varying stage sizes
- Conversion rates calculated accurately (validated against HubSpot report)
- Clicking stage opens drill-down modal within 200ms
- Export includes funnel image + conversion table

### Feature 3: Custom Metric Builder

**Description**: Allow users to define and track custom KPIs specific to their business.

**User Value**: Flexibility to track unique metrics (e.g., "Project Delivery Days", "Customer Satisfaction Score").

**UI Flow**:

1. **Settings → Custom Metrics → Create New Metric**
2. **Metric Definition Form**:
   - Name: "Average Project Delivery Time"
   - Unit: "Days"
   - Data Source: Manual Upload (CSV) OR Formula (e.g., `SUM(project_days) / COUNT(projects)`)
   - Frequency: Daily / Weekly / Monthly
3. **Data Upload** (if manual):
   - CSV template download
   - Upload CSV with columns: Date, Value
   - Validation: Check for date format, numeric values
4. **Chart Configuration**:
   - Chart type: Line / Bar / Area
   - Color: User selects from palette
   - Target line (optional): e.g., "Goal: 30 days"
5. **Save & Add to Dashboard**
   - Metric appears as new chart widget
   - Historical data rendered immediately

**Technical Implementation**:
- Data Source: `custom_metrics` table
- API Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/metrics` - Create metric
  - `POST /api/metrics/:id/data` - Upload data
  - `GET /api/metrics/:id` - Fetch metric values
- Formula Parsing: Use mathjs library for calculation logic
- Validation: Zod schema for CSV structure

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can create metric and see data within 30 seconds
- CSV upload validates format and shows error messages for invalid rows
- Formula metrics recalculate automatically when source data updates
- Chart renders with same styling as built-in charts

### Feature 4: Threshold Alerts

**Description**: Automated notifications when metrics cross user-defined thresholds.

**User Value**: Proactive problem detection (e.g., cash flow warnings, budget overruns).

**UI Flow**:

1. **Settings → Alerts → Create Alert**
2. **Alert Configuration Form**:
   - Alert Name: "Cash Flow Low Alert"
   - Metric: Select from dropdown (Revenue, Cash Flow, Custom Metrics, etc.)
   - Condition: Less Than / Greater Than / Equal To
   - Threshold: $50,000
   - Frequency: Check after each data sync / Check hourly
   - Notification Channels: Email (default) / Slack (requires integration)
3. **Notification Template**:
   - Subject: "🚨 Alert: Cash Flow below $50,000"
   - Body: Current value, threshold, trend chart, link to dashboard
4. **Save**

**Alert Evaluation Logic**:
- Trigger: After each data sync (n8n workflow completion)
- Check: Compare latest metric value to threshold
- Action: If condition met AND alert not recently triggered (debounce: 24 hours), send notification
- Logging: Record in `alerts` table (triggered_at, metric_value, notification_sent)

**Notification Delivery**:
- Email: SendGrid transactional email
- Slack: POST to webhook URL (configured in Settings → Integrations → Slack)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can create alert and receive test notification
- Alert triggers correctly when threshold crossed (validated via manual test)
- Alert does not re-trigger within 24-hour debounce period
- Email includes chart showing metric trend over last 30 days
- User can view alert history (last 90 days) in Settings → Alerts

---

### Feature 5: Integration Management

**Description**: Centralized UI for connecting, monitoring, and managing external integrations.

**User Value**: Single pane of glass for integration health, reduces support burden.

**UI Components**:

1. **Integration Dashboard** (Settings → Integrations)
   - Grid view showing all available integrations
   - Each card displays: Logo, Name, Status (Not Connected / Active / Error), Last Sync Time
   - "Connect" button for inactive integrations
   - "Configure" button for active integrations

2. **Connection Flow** (OAuth)
   - Click "Connect Xero"
   - Redirect to Xero authorization page
   - User approves access
   - Redirect back to Scriptum Arc
   - Success message: "Xero connected! Initial sync started."

3. **Integration Detail Page**
   - Status: Active, Last sync: 2 hours ago, Next sync: In 22 hours
   - Sync History Table: Date/Time, Status (Success/Failed), Records Synced, Duration, Error Message
   - Actions: "Sync Now", "Disconnect", "View Logs"
   - Configuration: Sync frequency (Daily / Hourly), Data filters (e.g., "Only sync invoices from last 12 months")

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If sync fails, integration status changes to "Error"
   - Error message displayed: "Xero token expired. Reconnect to resume syncing."
   - Email notification sent to admin users
   - Retry button available (attempts sync again)

**Technical Implementation**:
- OAuth Flow: Standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- Token Storage: Encrypted with AES-256-GCM, stored in `integrations` table
- Token Refresh: Automatic refresh before expiry (Xero tokens expire after 30 minutes)
- Sync Orchestration: n8n workflows triggered by cron schedule
- Error Logging: Write to `sync_logs` table + Sentry for exception tracking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can connect integration and see "Active" status within 1 minute
- Sync history displays last 30 sync attempts with timestamps
- Disconnecting integration revokes OAuth token immediately
- Error states provide actionable guidance (e.g., "Reconnect" button, not generic "Error")
- Manual "Sync Now" triggers sync within 30 seconds

## Out of Scope (MVP)

The following features are **explicitly excluded** from the MVP to maintain focus and accelerate launch:

### Excluded Features

| Feature | Rationale | Future Phase |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Mobile App (iOS/Android)** | Mobile web sufficient for MVP | Year 2 (React Native) |
| **White-Label/Multi-Brand** | Single-brand focus initially | Phase 6 (agency partnerships) |
| **AI/ML Insights** | Requires critical mass of data | Phase 7 (predictive analytics) |
| **Multi-Currency Support** | Target market is AU-only (AUD) | International expansion (Year 3) |
| **SSO/SAML** | Enterprise feature, not needed for SMEs | Enterprise tier (50+ users) |
| **Custom Workflow Builder** | Too complex for MVP, use n8n directly | Phase 8 (low-code automation) |
| **Real-Time Data (WebSockets)** | Daily sync sufficient for SMEs | Phase 9 (real-time dashboards) |
| **Data Warehouse Export (Snowflake, BigQuery)** | Overkill for SME data volumes | Enterprise tier |
| **Advanced Permissions (Field-Level)** | Role-based is sufficient | Phase 10 (enterprise security) |
| **API Rate Limiting (per user)** | Tenant-level limiting sufficient | Scale optimization |

### Explicitly Not Building

- ❌ No accounting features (invoicing, expense tracking) - Xero does this
- ❌ No CRM features (lead management, email campaigns) - HubSpot does this
- ❌ No project management (task assignment, time tracking) - Asana does this
- ❌ No data entry UI (customers enter data in source systems, we consolidate)

**Philosophy**: Scriptum Arc is a **read-only BI layer**. We aggregate and visualize data from systems of record, but we do not become a system of record ourselves.

---

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. **Customer Data Access**: Customers are willing and able to grant OAuth access to their business systems
2. **Data Quality**: Source systems (Xero, HubSpot) contain reasonably accurate data (garbage in = garbage out)
3. **Internet Connectivity**: Customers have reliable internet (cloud-based platform)
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Customers use modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox - last 2 versions)
5. **Billing**: Customers have credit cards and are comfortable with subscription billing
6. **AU Market**: Initial focus is Australia only (data residency, compliance, integrations)

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Owner | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------------|-------|------------|------------|
| **Vercel Availability** | Vercel Inc. | Medium | Backup deployment to Netlify (manual) |
| **Supabase Availability** | Supabase Inc. | Medium | Daily backups to S3, can restore to self-hosted Postgres |
| **Xero API Stability** | Xero Ltd. | Low | API versioning, maintain compatibility layer |
| **HubSpot API Stability** | HubSpot Inc. | Low | Same as Xero |
| **Stripe Payment Processing** | Stripe Inc. | Low | Industry standard, 99.99% uptime SLA |
| **n8n Open Source** | n8n GmbH | Low | Self-hosted, code is open source (can fork if abandoned) |
| **SendGrid Email Delivery** | Twilio/SendGrid | Low | Can swap to AWS SES or Postmark |
| **OAuth Provider Uptime** | Various | Medium | Provide manual CSV upload as fallback for initial data |

### External Constraints

1. **Australian Privacy Act Compliance**: Must store data in Australia, implement privacy controls
2. **OAuth Scopes**: Limited by what scopes external APIs provide (e.g., Xero read-only scopes)
3. **API Rate Limits**: Must respect rate limits (Xero: 60 req/min, HubSpot: 100 req/10s)
4. **Browser Limitations**: Chart rendering performance varies by browser (optimize for Chrome first)
