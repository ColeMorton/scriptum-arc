- Faster billing, improved cash flow

### Team Coordination

- Task assigned → Team member notified → Deadline reminders → Completion logged
- Less email, better accountability

## Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Consulting firm managing 10-15 active projects

**Before automation**:

- Create project in Asana manually (30 min per project)
- Assign tasks individually (20 min per project)
- Send client updates manually (15 min per update × 3 updates)
- Create invoices from project data (1 hour per milestone)
- **Total per project: 2.5 hours setup + 2.75 hours ongoing = 5.25 hours**
- **For 15 projects: 78 hours = $7,800/month**

**After automation**:

- Review auto-created projects (30 min per project)
- Exception handling (1 hour per project)
- **Total per project: 1.5 hours**
- **For 15 projects: 22.5 hours = $2,250/month**
- **Time saved: 55.5 hours/month = $5,550/month = $66,600/year**

**ROI**: $66,600/year on $13,000 investment = **5:1 return, 10-week payback**

4. **Dependencies**: Set task dependencies for automatic scheduling
5. **Portfolios**: Group related projects for portfolio view
