## Overview

Email integration allows automated notifications, customer communications, and team updates as part of your business workflows. Works with Gmail, Outlook, or any SMTP provider.

---

## What Email Integration Enables

### Automatic Customer Communications

- Invoice sent → Email with payment link
- Payment received → Thank you email
- Order shipped → Tracking notification
- Milestone reached → Progress update

### Team Notifications

- New lead → Sales team notified
- Task assigned → Team member email
- Invoice overdue → Accounts team alert
- Project behind schedule → Manager notification

### Email Sequences

- New customer → Welcome series (Day 0, 3, 7, 14)
- Invoice unpaid → Reminder sequence (7, 14, 30 days)
- Order delivered → Review request (7 days later)
- Inactive customer → Re-engagement campaign (90 days)

## Common Workflows

### Customer Lifecycle Emails

1. Welcome email when customer added
2. Invoice notification when invoice sent
3. Payment confirmation when paid
4. Project updates at milestones
5. Completion thank you and feedback request

### Internal Team Notifications

1. New lead alert to sales rep
2. Task assignment notifications
3. Deadline reminders
4. Exception alerts (workflow failed, payment overdue, stock low)
5. Daily/weekly summary reports

## Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Service business sending ~50 emails/week manually

**Before automation**:

- Invoice emails: 10/week × 5 min = 50 min
- Payment thank you: 8/week × 3 min = 24 min
- Project updates: 15/week × 10 min = 150 min
- Follow-ups: 15/week × 5 min = 75 min
- **Total: 5 hours/week = $13,000/year**

**After automation**:

- Everything automatic
- Review and custom emails only: 30 min/week = $1,300/year
- **Time saved: 4.5 hours/week = $11,700/year**

**ROI**: Part of broader automation package, but email automation alone saves 4-5 hours/week per business

## Email Templates

We create templates for:

- Invoice notifications
- Payment confirmations
- Project updates
- Welcome emails
- Feedback requests
- Appointment reminders
- And more

Templates include your branding and can be customized per workflow.

## Setup Options

**Option 1: Gmail/Outlook OAuth** (Recommended for small volume)

- Connect your business Gmail or Outlook account
- Secure OAuth authentication
- Sends from your email address
- Limited to ~500 emails/day

**Option 2: SMTP Provider** (Recommended for higher volume)

- Use SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar
- Higher sending limits (10,000+/day)
- Better deliverability
- Email tracking and analytics
- Cost: $10-50/month for SME volumes

**Recommendation**: Start with Gmail/Outlook, upgrade to SMTP provider if volume grows

---

## Best Practices

1. **Professional Templates**: Use HTML email templates with your branding
2. **Personalization**: Include customer name, invoice number, specific details
3. **Clear Subject Lines**: "Invoice #1234 from ABC Company" not "Invoice"
4. **Unsubscribe Links**: For marketing emails (legal requirement)
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Send test emails before going live

---

## Email Deliverability

**Why emails might go to spam**:

- Sending from personal Gmail/Outlook at high volume
- No SPF/DKIM records configured
- Poor template formatting
- Spammy content or subject lines

**How we prevent this**:

- Recommend proper SMTP provider for volume
- Configure SPF/DKIM records
- Professional templates
- Compliance with email best practices
