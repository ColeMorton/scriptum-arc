## Overview

This directory documents the business system integrations that Zixly automates for SME clients. Each integration guide focuses on business outcomes and common workflows rather than technical implementation details.

---

## Integration Approach

### Security and Authentication

All integrations use **OAuth 2.0** or **API key authentication**:

- **OAuth 2.0** (Xero, HubSpot, Shopify): Most secure, user grants permission via their account
- **API Keys** (some systems): Secure tokens generated in the system's settings
- **Credentials stored securely**: Encrypted in AWS Secrets Manager (production) or local secure storage (development)

**What this means for clients**: You click "Connect to Xero" and log in with your Xero credentials. We never see your password, and you can revoke access anytime.

### Data Flow

**How automation works**:

1. **Trigger**: Something happens in one system (invoice paid, deal won, order placed)
2. **Workflow Executes**: Our automation receives the trigger and runs the workflow steps
3. **Actions**: Updates made to other systems (create invoice, update CRM, send email)
4. **Monitoring**: We log everything so you can see what happened when

**Where data lives**: Your data stays in your business systems (Xero, HubSpot, etc.). Our automation reads from and writes to your systems but doesn't permanently store your business data.

### Error Handling

**What happens if something fails**:

- **Automatic retry**: Most temporary failures (network issues, system busy) automatically retry with exponential backoff
- **Error notifications**: Critical failures notify you and us immediately
- **Manual resolution**: If automation can't resolve, we investigate and fix
- **Audit trail**: Complete log of what happened for troubleshooting

2. Lead qualified → Follow-up sequence begins
3. Deal won in CRM → Invoice created in accounting + Project created + Welcome email sent
4. Project milestones reached → Progress invoices generated
5. Payment received → Thank you email + CRM updated + Project status updated

**Time Saved**: 10-15 hours/week for 15-30 employee business

---

### Financial Automation

**Scenario**: Time Tracking → Billing → Payment → Reporting

**Systems Involved**: Project Management + Accounting + CRM + Email

**Workflow**:

1. Time logged in project management → Daily/weekly compilation

5. End of month → Financial reports compiled and emailed

**Time Saved**: 8-12 hours/week for professional services firms

**Scenario**: Order Processing → Fulfillment → Inventory → Reordering

**Systems Involved**: E-commerce + Inventory Management + Accounting + Supplier Portal

**Workflow**:

1. Order placed → Inventory allocated + Pick list generated
2. Order shipped → Customer notification + Tracking link
3. Inventory decreases → Check reorder threshold
4. Stock low → Supplier notified + Purchase order created
5. Stock received → Inventory updated + Xero bill created

**Time Saved**: 15-20 hours/week for e-commerce businesses

---

### Project Delivery Automation

**Scenario**: Sales → Project Setup → Execution → Delivery → Closeout

**Systems Involved**: CRM + Project Management + File Storage + Accounting + Email

**Workflow**:

1. Deal won → Project folder created + Team assigned + Tasks generated
2. Project starts → Client portal access + Kickoff meeting scheduled
3. Milestones reached → Progress invoices + Client updates
4. Deliverables completed → Client approval workflow
5. Project complete → Final invoice + Files archived + Feedback request

**Time Saved**: 6-10 hours/week per project manager

3. **Test connections** to ensure working
4. **Backup and fallback** procedures documented

### Phase 3: Workflow Development
