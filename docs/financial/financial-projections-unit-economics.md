## Unit Economics Deep-Dive

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Calculation**: Total Sales & Marketing Spend ÷ Number of New Customers

**Year 1 CAC Calculation**:

- Marketing & Advertising: $36,000
- Sales Tools: $3,600
- Founder Time Allocated to Sales (30%): $39,960
- Travel (Sales Meetings): $4,800
- **Total Sales & Marketing**: $84,360
- **New Customers (Year 1)**: 24 (accounting for churn, net 18)
- **CAC**: $84,360 ÷ 24 = **$3,515**

**Blended CAC (Steady State, Year 2-3)**: $2,850

- Improved efficiency as processes mature
- Content marketing begins generating inbound leads (lower cost)
- Referrals from satisfied customers (zero cost)

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Calculation**: (Average Revenue Per Account × Gross Margin) ÷ Monthly Churn Rate

**Assumptions**:

- Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA): $1,620/month
- Gross Margin: 85% (steady state)
- Monthly Churn Rate: 3.5%
- Average Customer Lifetime: 28.6 months (1 ÷ 0.035)

**LTV Calculation**:

- Monthly Gross Profit per Customer: $1,620 × 0.85 = $1,377
- Customer Lifetime: 28.6 months
- **LTV**: $1,377 × 28.6 = **$39,382**

**Alternative LTV (Conservative)**:

- If ARPA = $1,500, Gross Margin = 82%, Churn = 4%
- LTV = ($1,500 × 0.82) ÷ 0.04 = **$30,750**

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Optimal Scenario**: $39,382 ÷ $2,850 = **13.8:1**

**Conservative Scenario**: $30,750 ÷ $3,515 = **8.7:1**

**Industry Benchmarks**:

- <3:1 = Unsustainable
- 3:1 to 5:1 = Healthy for growth-stage SaaS
- > 5:1 = Excellent unit economics

**Scriptum Arc**: 8.7:1 to 13.8:1 = **Excellent**

### Payback Period

**Calculation**: CAC ÷ (Monthly Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin)

**Payback Period**: $2,850 ÷ ($1,620 × 0.85) = **2.1 months**

**Industry Benchmarks**:

- <12 months = Excellent
- 12-18 months = Good
- > 18 months = Concerning

**Scriptum Arc**: 2.1 months = **Excellent** (immediate cash recovery)

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Movements

**MRR Components**:

- **New MRR**: Revenue from new customers
- **Expansion MRR**: Upgrades (Starter → Professional → Enterprise)
- **Contraction MRR**: Downgrades
- **Churned MRR**: Lost customers

**Year 1 MRR Movement (Example Month 12)**:

- Starting MRR (Month 11): $29,400
- New MRR: 2 customers × $1,620 avg = $3,240
- Expansion MRR: 1 upgrade (Starter → Pro) = $600
- Contraction MRR: 0
- Churned MRR: 1 customer × $1,200 = -$1,200
- **Ending MRR (Month 12)**: $32,040

**Net MRR Growth Rate**: ($32,040 - $29,400) ÷ $29,400 = **9% monthly growth**

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Calculation**: (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) ÷ Starting MRR

**Year 2 NRR Calculation**:

- Starting Cohort MRR (Year 1): $30,600
- Expansion MRR (Upgrades): $4,200
- Churned MRR: -$10,710 (35% annual churn)
- **Ending MRR from Year 1 Cohort**: $24,090
- **NRR**: $24,090 ÷ $30,600 = **78.7%**

**Industry Context**:

- SaaS companies with NRR >100% are growing without new customers
- SME SaaS typically has NRR of 85-95% due to higher churn
- Scriptum Arc Year 2 NRR of 78.7% is **below target**

**Improvement Strategies** (to reach 90%+ NRR):

1. Reduce churn through quarterly business reviews (QBRs)
2. Increase expansion revenue via dashboard add-ons and tier upgrades
3. Introduce annual contracts with discounts (locks in customers, reduces churn)
4. Implement customer success playbooks (proactive value delivery)

## Scenario Analysis

### Best-Case Scenario

**Assumptions**:

- Customer acquisition 25% higher than base case
- Churn reduced to 2.5% monthly (30% annually)
- 20% of customers upgrade to higher tier annually

| Metric                      | Year 1   | Year 2   | Year 3     |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Customers (End of Year)** | 23       | 58       | 118        |
| **MRR (End of Year)**       | $39,780  | $102,900 | $209,480   |
| **Total Revenue**           | $298,500 | $874,200 | $1,893,600 |
| **Net Profit**              | $12,400  | $412,850 | $1,048,320 |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio**           | 18.2:1   | 19.5:1   | 20.1:1     |

### Worst-Case Scenario

**Assumptions**:

- Customer acquisition 30% lower than base case
- Churn increases to 5% monthly (46% annually)
- No tier upgrades; 10% of customers downgrade

| Metric                      | Year 1   | Year 2   | Year 3   |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Customers (End of Year)** | 12       | 24       | 42       |
| **MRR (End of Year)**       | $19,440  | $38,880  | $68,040  |
| **Total Revenue**           | $156,800 | $364,320 | $625,680 |
| **Net Profit**              | -$68,500 | $8,245   | $144,530 |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio**           | 4.2:1    | 5.8:1    | 6.9:1    |

**Implications**:

- Worst-case still achieves profitability by Year 2
- Even at reduced scale, unit economics remain viable (LTV:CAC >3:1)
- Lower revenue requires tighter cost control (reduce OpEx by 15-20%)

### Most-Likely Scenario (Base Case)

**As presented in main projections**:

- 18 customers Year 1, 42 Year 2, 78 Year 3
- Breakeven Month 10

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Revenue Risks

**Risk 1: Higher-than-expected churn**

- **Impact**: Reduces LTV, increases CAC payback period, slows MRR growth
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement customer success program (QBRs, proactive support)
  - Offer annual contracts with 15% discount (locks in customers)
  - Build churn prediction model (identify at-risk customers early)
  - Add product features that increase stickiness (saved reports, custom alerts)

**Risk 2: Slower customer acquisition**

- **Impact**: Delays profitability, extends cash runway requirements
- **Mitigation**:
  - Diversify lead generation (content marketing, partnerships, referrals)
  - Reduce CAC through inbound marketing (SEO, LinkedIn thought leadership)
  - Pilot channel partnerships with accountants (referral fees)
  - Offer pilot programs to reduce purchase friction

**Risk 3: Pricing pressure / inability to charge premium rates**

- **Impact**: Lower ARPA, compressed margins, reduced profitability
- **Mitigation**:
  - Emphasize bespoke value in positioning (not competing on price)
  - Demonstrate ROI clearly (case studies, calculators)
  - Bundle additional services (strategy consulting, annual health checks)
  - Target less price-sensitive segments (professional services, construction)

### Cost Risks

**Risk 4: Infrastructure costs scale faster than expected**

- **Impact**: COGS increase, gross margin compression
- **Mitigation**:
  - Negotiate volume discounts with Supabase/Vercel at customer milestones
  - Architect for efficiency (query optimization, caching strategies)
  - Monitor unit costs monthly (cost per customer)
  - Consider reserved instances or annual commitments for predictable savings

**Risk 5: Implementation time exceeds estimates**

- **Impact**: Reduced throughput (fewer customers per month), higher labor costs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Standardize implementation playbooks
  - Build reusable dashboard templates by industry
  - Automate integration setup (OAuth flows, schema mapping)
  - Qualify customers better (reject overly complex edge cases early)

### Market Risks

**Risk 6: Competitive response (incumbents drop prices or new entrants)**

- **Impact**: Pricing pressure, differentiation challenges
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on bespoke positioning (hard to commoditize)
  - Build proprietary IP (custom n8n workflows, industry templates)
  - Lock in customers with high switching costs (integrated workflows)
  - Expand into adjacent services (BI consulting, data strategy)

**Risk 7: Integration partners change APIs or pricing**

- **Impact**: Development work required, potential COGS increases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Diversify integration portfolio (don't over-rely on one API)
  - Build abstraction layer (easier to swap integrations)
  - Monitor partner roadmaps and maintain relationships
  - Pass through API cost increases to customers (contractual provision)

### Operational Risks

**Risk 8: Solo operator dependency (founder burnout or unavailability)**

- **Impact**: Customer support suffers, sales pipeline stalls, churn increases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Document all processes (implementation, support, sales)
  - Automate repetitive tasks (onboarding emails, data syncs, alerts)
  - Hire part-time contractor at 20 customers for overflow support
  - Plan for first full-time hire at 40 customers (customer success role)
