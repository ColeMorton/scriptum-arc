## Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing

**Approach**: Price based on time saved and business value delivered, not hours worked

**Value Drivers**:

- **Time Savings**: Automated workflows save 10-30 hours/week of manual work
- **Accuracy**: Eliminate 95%+ of data entry errors and duplicate handling
- **Growth Enablement**: Handle 30-50% more business without adding admin staff
- **Cash Flow**: Faster invoicing and payment tracking improves cash position
- **Decision Making**: Real-time dashboards enable data-driven decisions

**ROI Examples**:

**Professional Services Firm** (15 employees):

- Time saved: 15 hours/week at $90/hour = $70,200/year
- Investment: $8,000 (Complete Automation)
- **ROI: 9:1 in first year**
- **Payback: 7 weeks**

**Construction Company** (25 employees):

- Time saved: 12 hours/week at $75/hour = $46,800/year
- Investment: $12,000 (Complete Automation)
- **ROI: 4:1 in first year**
- **Payback: 13 weeks**

**E-commerce Business** (10 employees):

- Time saved: 20 hours/week (order processing) + stockout reduction = $75,000/year
- Investment: $15,000 (Enterprise Suite)
- **ROI: 5:1 in first year**
- **Payback: 10 weeks**

### Competitive Positioning

**Advantages Over Competitors**:

- **SME-appropriate pricing**: $3K-$40K projects vs $100K+ from large consultancies
- **Local Brisbane presence**: In-person meetings, same timezone, understand local market
- **Business-focused**: We speak business language, not technical jargon
- **Fast implementation**: 1-12 weeks vs months or years for IT projects
- **Transparent pricing**: Fixed-price projects, no hidden hourly consulting fees

**Competitive Analysis**:

- **DIY Integration Platforms** (Zapier, Make): $0-$1,000/year but requires technical skills, limited to simple workflows, no consulting
- **IT Consultants**: $150-$300/hour, minimum 40-hour engagements, tech-focused not business-focused
- **Offshore Automation Services**: $50-$100/hour but timezone issues, communication challenges, no local presence
- **Large Consultancies**: $200-$400/hour, $100K+ minimums, enterprise-focused not SME-appropriate
- **Zixly positioning**: $150-$200 effective hourly rate, SME-focused, local + responsive, business outcomes-focused

## Risk Management

### Financial Risks

**Slow Client Acquisition**:

- Risk: Takes longer than 3 months to close first clients
- Mitigation: Start with Starter packages ($3K-$5K) for faster closes
- Mitigation: Heavy focus on accountant partnerships (warm referrals)
- Backup Plan: Consulting services to generate immediate revenue

**Client Non-Payment**:

- Risk: Client doesn't pay final invoice after project complete
- Mitigation: 30% deposit required before work starts
- Mitigation: 40% payment at midpoint milestone
- Mitigation: Legal terms allowing workflow shutdown for non-payment

**Pricing Too Low**:

- Risk: Market will pay more than $3K-$40K pricing
- Mitigation: Test with initial clients, increase pricing based on demand
- Mitigation: Track competitor pricing and adjust quarterly
- Mitigation: Value-based pricing discussions focus on ROI, not cost

### Operational Risks

**Technical Complexity**:

- Risk: Integrations more complex than expected, blow timeline
- Mitigation: Build time buffers into estimates (20-30% contingency)
- Mitigation: Develop workflow template library to speed delivery
- Mitigation: Clear scope definition with change order process

**Client Expectation Mismatch**:

- Risk: Client expects more than scope includes
- Mitigation: Detailed proposal with specific deliverables listed
- Mitigation: Demo similar workflows before project starts
- Mitigation: Weekly check-ins during implementation

**Vendor API Changes**:

- Risk: Xero, HubSpot, Shopify change APIs, breaking workflows
- Mitigation: Monitor vendor API announcements and changelogs
- Mitigation: Build abstraction layer so changes isolated
- Mitigation: Monthly management contracts cover maintenance

## Conclusion

Zixly's SME business automation model is financially viable with strong unit economics:

- **High Gross Margins**: 70-80% due to service-based delivery
- **Strong LTV:CAC**: 16:1 (3-year) indicates sustainable growth
- **Fast Payback**: 1-4 months CAC recovery enables rapid scaling
- **Recurring Revenue**: 35-60% mix provides predictable income
- **Large Market**: 5,000+ Brisbane SMEs with 3+ systems to integrate

Year 1 target of $200K-$400K is achievable with 20-30 clients at $8K-$15K average project value plus 8-15 monthly management clients. The model balances project revenue (faster growth) with recurring revenue (stability and compounding).

Key success factors are accountant partnerships (referral channel), standardized workflow templates (faster delivery), and strong case studies demonstrating clear ROI (easier sales).
