## Key Concepts

### Dogfooding Strategy

**"Eat Your Own Dogfood"**: Zixly uses cloud-native DevOps patterns (Docker, K8s, Terraform) to run its own internal operations.

**Benefits**:

- **Authentic expertise**: Daily usage builds genuine knowledge
- **Real-world proof**: Demonstrate value to clients
- **Continuous improvement**: Daily usage drives optimization
- **Client credibility**: "We use these tools to run our own business"

### Open-Source Strategy

**Phase 1** (Current): Internal operations and expertise building  
**Phase 2** (Q2 2025): GitHub release with comprehensive documentation  
**Phase 3** (H2 2025): Community engagement and knowledge sharing

**Benefits**:

- **Transparency**: Builds trust with clients
- **Community**: Share patterns and knowledge
- **Demonstration**: Live system shows capabilities
- **Differentiation**: Unique competitive advantage

### Architecture Principles

- **Cloud-Native**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure version-controlled
- **Event-Driven**: Webhook-triggered pipeline orchestration
- **Full Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- **Local-First**: LocalStack enables zero-cost development

---

## Implementation Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 (Dashboard & API)  
**Progress**: 90% MVP Complete

**Completed**:

- ✅ Phase 1: Data Foundation (Database, Auth, APIs)
- ✅ Phase 2: Infrastructure & Services (Docker, Webhooks, Workers)
- ✅ Phase 1.5: LocalStack + Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

**In Progress**:

- 🔄 Phase 3: Dashboard & API (Pipeline management UI)

**Planned**:

- ⏳ Phase 4: Production Readiness (Performance, Security, Testing)

See **[Implementation Status](./implementation/status.md)** for detailed milestone tracking.
