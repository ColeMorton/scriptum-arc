## General Questions

### What is business automation?

Business automation is connecting your existing business systems (like Xero, HubSpot, Shopify, Asana) so they work together automatically. Instead of manually entering the same customer information into your CRM and then into your accounting software, automation does it for you instantly and perfectly every time.

### How is this different from doing it myself with Zapier or Make?

**DIY Platforms (Zapier, Make)**:

- You build and maintain workflows yourself
- Good for simple workflows (2-3 steps)
- Requires technical comfort with automation tools
- Limited support when things break
- Monthly cost ($50-$500/month)

**Zixly Service**:

- We build, test, and maintain workflows for you
- Handle complex multi-step workflows
- Includes business process consulting
- Ongoing support and optimization
- One-time implementation cost ($3K-$40K) + optional monthly management

**Best for**: Most SME owners don't have time to learn automation tools - they just want their admin work to disappear. That's what we do.

### What makes Zixly different from IT consultants?

**Traditional IT Consultants**:

- Focus on technology and infrastructure
- Speak in technical jargon
- Hourly billing (unpredictable costs)
- Months-long projects

**Zixly**:

- Focus on business outcomes (time saved, errors reduced)
- Speak business language, not tech talk
- Fixed-price projects (predictable costs)
- 1-12 week turnaround
- Business process consulting included

### Do I need to be technical?

**No.** You need to know:

- What systems you use (Xero, HubSpot, etc.)
- What takes time in your business
- What frustrates your team

We handle all the technical work. After implementation, using the automation is as simple as using any other business software.

## Technical Questions

### What systems can you integrate?

**Accounting**: Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks, Reckon

**CRM**: HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Zoho CRM

**Project Management**: Asana, Monday.com, Trello, ClickUp

**E-commerce**: Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce

**Communication**: Email (Gmail, Outlook), Slack, Microsoft Teams

**File Storage**: Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive

**HR/Payroll**: Employment Hero, KeyPay, Deputy

**Scheduling**: Calendly, Acuity, SimplyBook.me

**And 100+ others**. If it has an API or supports webhooks, we can probably integrate it.

### Is my data secure?

**Yes. Your data is as secure as your existing systems.**

**How it works**:

- We connect to your systems using OAuth (same security as when you login)
- Data flows between your systems automatically
- We don't permanently store your business data
- All connections are encrypted (bank-level security)
- Hosted in Australia (Australian data residency)

**You control**:

- You can revoke access anytime
- You can see audit trails of what happened
- Your data stays in your business systems (Xero, HubSpot, etc.)

**Compliance**: Australian Privacy Act compliant, can sign NDA if required

### Can I export everything and leave?

**Yes. You own everything.**

What you get:

- Complete documentation of all workflows
- Diagrams showing what connects to what
- Access to everything (workflows continue running)
- Option to manage yourself or hire another provider

**No vendor lock-in.** Many clients choose to stay because monthly management ($500-$2K/month) is cheaper than hiring someone to manage it, but you're not required to.

### What if one of my systems changes or updates?

**That's what monthly management covers:**

- We monitor for API changes from vendors (Xero, HubSpot, etc.)
- Update workflows when systems change
- Test regularly to catch issues before they impact you

**Without monthly management**: You'll need to hire us or someone else to fix when things break due to system updates.

### Do you work with businesses outside Brisbane?

**Primary Service Area**: Brisbane and South East Queensland (in-person available)

## Common Concerns

### "I'm worried my team will resist change"

**This is normal.** Here's how we handle it:

**Change Management Included**:

- Start with workflows that make their lives easier (not harder)
- Involve team in identifying pain points (they know best)
- Training focuses on "what's in it for them"
- Gradual rollout (not everything at once)
- Champions program (identify early adopters)

**Most teams love it**: Once they see they're not doing data entry anymore, resistance disappears.

### "What if it breaks and you're not available?"

**Multiple safeguards**:

1. **Workflows are robust**: Tested thoroughly, retry logic built in
2. **Monitoring alerts us**: We often fix before you notice
3. **Fallback procedures**: Documentation for what to do if something fails
4. **Your systems still work**: If automation breaks, you can revert to manual temporarily

**Monthly management includes**: 24/7 monitoring, fast response times, backup team members

### "I'm worried about the learning curve"

**Using automation is easier than learning your original systems:**

**For most users**: Zero learning curve (automation just happens in background)
**For administrators**: 2-3 hours of training, then occasional monitoring
**Support available**: Email, phone, video calls whenever you need help

**After 2-4 weeks**: Most clients forget how they did things manually.

### "What if I need something you can't do?"

**Honest answer**: If it's technically impossible, we'll tell you upfront (rare).

**Usually**: We can find a solution, just might be different approach than expected.

**Options if complex**:

- Phased approach (build simpler version first, expand later)
- Manual step in middle of automation (better than fully manual)
- Alternative system recommendation (sometimes the tool is the problem, not the automation)

### "My business is unique, will this work?"

**Every business is unique.** That's why we don't sell templates.

**Our approach**:

- We learn YOUR specific workflows
- We build automation for YOUR business
- We test with YOUR actual data
- We train YOUR team on YOUR processes

**Industry-specific experience helps** but isn't required. Good business automation adapts to any business model.
