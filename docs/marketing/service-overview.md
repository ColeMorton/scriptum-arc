- Bug fixes and adjustments
- Monthly performance report (time saved, workflows executed, errors prevented)

- Unlimited integration updates
- Same-day support response
- Dedicated Slack or Teams channel (real-time access)
- Bi-weekly optimization sessions
- Quarterly business review with executive team

**Best For**: Established businesses with mission-critical workflows that can't afford downtime

---

**Why Choose Monthly Management?**

**Without Management** (Self-Managed):

- When integration breaks, your workflows stop until you figure it out
- New opportunities for automation go unnoticed
- Workflows become outdated as your business changes
- You're on your own troubleshooting errors

**With Management**:

- We monitor 24/7 and fix issues before they impact you
- We proactively suggest new workflows as we see opportunities
- We keep everything current as your systems update
- You have experts on speed dial when you need help

**Real Example**: Client with 8 workflows, no management vs managed

**Without Management** (First Year):

- 3 workflow failures (1-2 days to notice and fix each) = $3,000 lost productivity
- Missed 4 automation opportunities = $8,000 value left on table
- Time spent troubleshooting = $2,000

**With Management** ($1,200/month = $14,400/year):

- Zero workflow downtime (we fixed before client noticed)
- 4 new workflows added (captured that $8,000 value)
- Zero client time troubleshooting

**Net Value**: $14,400 cost - $13,000 value = **Managed service pays for itself PLUS adds $8,000 value**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from doing it myself with Zapier or Make?

**DIY Platforms** (Zapier, Make):

- ✅ **Pros**: Lower monthly cost ($50-$500/month), you control everything
- ❌ **Cons**: You need to learn the tool, build workflows yourself, troubleshoot when broken, limited to simple workflows

**Zixly Service**:

- ✅ **Pros**: Done for you, handles complex workflows, ongoing support, business consulting included
- ❌ **Cons**: Higher upfront cost ($3K-$40K)

**Best Fit**:

- DIY if you're technical, have time to learn, and workflows are simple
- Zixly if you want it done professionally, don't have time to learn, or workflows are complex

**Many clients try DIY first, then come to us when they realize it's harder than expected or they don't have time**

---

### Do I need technical knowledge?

**No.** We handle all the technical work.

You need to know:

- What systems you use (Xero, HubSpot, Shopify, etc.)
- What takes time in your business
- What your workflows currently look like

We'll handle:

- Connecting systems securely
- Building the automation
- Testing thoroughly
- Training your team

**After implementation, using the automation is as simple as using any other software.** If you can use Xero or HubSpot, you can use our automation.

---

### What systems can you integrate?

**Accounting**: Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks, Reckon

**CRM**: HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Zoho CRM

**Project Management**: Asana, Monday.com, Trello, ClickUp

**E-commerce**: Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce

**Other**: Stripe, PayPal, Mailchimp, Typeform, QuickBooks Time, and 100+ others

**Can't Find Your System?** Most systems with an API can be integrated. Ask us!

---

### Is my data secure?

**Yes. Your data is as secure as your existing systems.**

**How It Works**:

- Automation runs in the cloud (AWS in Australia)
- Connects to your systems using OAuth (same as when you login)
- Data passes through our automation but isn't permanently stored
- All connections are encrypted (bank-level security)
- Australian data residency (hosted in Sydney)

**You Control Access**:

- You can revoke access anytime
- Role-based permissions (who can see what)
- Audit trails (see what happened when)

**Compliance**:

- Australian Privacy Act compliant
- Your data stays in your systems (Xero, HubSpot, etc.)
- We can sign NDA if required

---

### What happens if you're hit by a bus? (The "bus factor")

**You own everything, so you're not locked in:**

**What You'll Have**:

- Complete documentation of all workflows
- Diagrams showing what connects to what
- Login access to all systems
- Workflows continue running without us

**Your Options**:

1. **Hire another automation provider** - Give them our documentation
2. **Bring it in-house** - Hire someone to manage it
3. **Revert to manual** - Turn off automation if needed

**Most clients add monthly management** ($500-$2K/month) to avoid this risk. We monitor, maintain, and have backup team members.

---

### How long until I see return on investment?

**Typical Payback Periods**:

- **Starter** ($3K-$5K): 8-16 weeks (fast wins)
- **Complete** ($8K-$15K): 12-24 weeks (more comprehensive)
- **Enterprise** ($20K-$40K): 20-40 weeks (complex but high value)

**Factors Affecting ROI**:

- How much time workflows save (more time = faster payback)
- Cost of your time (higher hourly value = faster payback)
- How many people benefit (more users = faster payback)
- How often workflows run (daily vs weekly matters)

**Real Example**:

- Investment: $12,000 (Complete Automation)
- Time saved: 15 hours/week
- Value: $90/hour (manager's time)
- Annual value: $70,200
- **Payback**: 9 weeks

---

### Can I start small and add more later?

**Yes! This is the recommended approach.**

**Typical Growth Path**:

1. **Month 1-2**: Start with **Starter** package ($3K-$5K)
   - Prove value with 2-3 key workflows
   - Build confidence in automation
   - Get team comfortable with changes

2. **Month 3-4**: Add **Basic Management** ($500/month)
   - Keep workflows running smoothly
   - Add 1 new workflow per month
   - Identify next opportunities

3. **Month 6-12**: Upgrade to **Complete** ($8K-$15K additional)
   - More systems connected
   - Complex workflows automated
   - Full business visibility

4. **Year 2+**: **Enterprise** level or multiple locations
   - Industry-specific customization
   - Advanced analytics
   - Multi-location coordination

**Why This Works**:

- Lower initial investment reduces risk
- Prove value before expanding
- Learn what works for your business
- Build trust incrementally
- Team adapts gradually (not overwhelmed)

---

### What if I want to cancel monthly management?

**Flexible Terms**:

- **Initial Commitment**: 3 months minimum (gives us time to understand your business)
- **After 3 Months**: Month-to-month, cancel anytime with 30 days notice
- **No Long-Term Contracts**: We earn your business every month

**If You Cancel**:

- Workflows keep running (they're in your systems)
- You keep all documentation
- You can manage yourself or hire someone else
- You can always come back if needed

**What Most Clients Do**:

- 70% continue with monthly management (it pays for itself)
- 20% reduce tier (Enterprise to Professional or Professional to Basic)
- 10% go self-managed (hired in-house or reduced automation needs)

**No Hard Feelings**: We'd rather you get value on your terms than feel locked in.
