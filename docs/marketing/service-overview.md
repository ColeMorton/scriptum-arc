## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from hiring a full-time DevOps engineer?

**Full-Time DevOps Engineer**:

- Cost: $120k-$180k/year salary + 30% benefits = $156k-$234k total
- Recruitment: 2-3 months to hire, 3-6 months to ramp up
- Knowledge gaps: Single engineer may lack Kubernetes OR Terraform expertise
- Vacation/sick leave: Need backup coverage

**Zixly Services**:

- Cost: $5k-$60k project + optional $2k-$5k/month managed services = $29k-$120k/year
- Immediate: Start in 1-2 weeks, delivery in 2-16 weeks
- Deep expertise: Senior engineers with Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS certifications
- Always available: No vacation gaps, managed services cover 24/7

**Best Fit**: Use Zixly to build infrastructure (2-16 weeks), then transition to in-house DevOps engineer for day-to-day operations, or use managed services until team size justifies full-time hire (usually 20-50 engineers).

---

### Do you work with startups or only established businesses?

**We work with both!**

**Startups (< 10 engineers)**: Pipeline MVP ($5k-$8k) is perfect for early-stage companies needing reliable automation without breaking the bank. Docker Compose infrastructure can handle 10-100 jobs/day and costs $0-$50/month in AWS.

**Growth Stage (10-50 engineers)**: DevOps Foundation ($12k-$20k) provides production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure that scales with you. Most clients at this stage also add managed services ($2k-$3.5k/month).

**Enterprise (50+ engineers)**: Enterprise Cloud ($30k-$60k) for mission-critical infrastructure with multi-region, compliance requirements, and high-availability SLAs.

---

### What if we already have some infrastructure in place?

**No problem!** We can:

1. **Audit & Improve**: Review existing infrastructure, identify risks and inefficiencies, provide optimization plan.
2. **Migrate**: Gradually move from existing setup to modern cloud-native architecture (zero downtime migrations).
3. **Augment**: Add missing pieces (observability, auto-scaling, disaster recovery) to existing infrastructure.
4. **Standardize**: Codify existing infrastructure in Terraform, add CI/CD pipelines.

**Discovery Workshop** ($500) is the best starting point to assess current state and design migration plan.

---

### How do managed services work? What if we need to scale back?

**Flexible Engagement**:

- **Initial Commitment**: 3-month minimum (allows us to learn your infrastructure and establish baseline)
- **After 3 Months**: Month-to-month, cancel anytime with 30 days notice
- **Scaling Down**: Can drop from Enterprise to Full Managed to Basic Monitoring as needed
- **Scaling Up**: Can upgrade tiers mid-month (prorated)

**No Lock-In**: All infrastructure is yours (Terraform code, AWS account, GitHub repo). If you cancel managed services, you retain full ownership and can operate independently or hire another provider.

---

### Do you offer training for our team?

**Yes!** Training is included in all projects:

- **Pipeline MVP**: 2-hour handover session covering Docker, job queues, monitoring
- **DevOps Foundation**: 8 hours of training (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform workshops)
- **Enterprise Cloud**: 12+ hours of training plus on-call shadowing

**Additional Training**:

- Custom workshops ($150/hour per attendee, min 3 attendees)
- Ongoing training as part of managed services (quarterly workshops)
- Access to our internal documentation and runbooks

**Goal**: Make your team self-sufficient, not dependent on external consultants.

---

### What happens if something goes wrong after launch?

**Support Periods**:

- Pipeline MVP: 30 days post-launch support included
- DevOps Foundation: 60 days post-launch support
- Enterprise Cloud: 90 days (3 months managed services included)

**During Support Period**:

- Bug fixes and adjustments (no additional cost)
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Email and Slack support (< 4 hour response time)
- Incident response for infrastructure issues

**After Support Period**:

- Managed services (monthly retainer, SLA-based response times)
- On-demand consulting ($200-$300/hour)
- Annual maintenance contract (discounted rate)

**SLA Guarantees** (with Managed Services):

- Basic Monitoring: 9am-5pm AEST response
- Full Managed: < 1 hour incident response (24/7)
- Enterprise Support: < 30 min incident response (24/7)

---

### Can we start small and scale up later?

**Absolutely! This is the recommended approach.**

**Typical Growth Path**:

1. **Month 1-2**: Pipeline MVP ($6k) - Prove concept with Docker Compose locally
2. **Month 3-4**: Add Basic Monitoring ($2k/month) - 24/7 eyes on your infrastructure
3. **Month 6-8**: Upgrade to DevOps Foundation ($16k) - Migrate to Kubernetes on AWS
4. **Month 9+**: Full Managed Services ($3.5k/month) - Focus on product while we handle infrastructure

**Why This Works**:

- Validate business value before large infrastructure investment
- Learn team's capabilities and preferences before cloud deployment
- Iterate on workflow design in low-cost Docker Compose environment
- Build trust with small project before committing to long-term partnership

---

### Do you work outside Brisbane?

**Primary Market**: Brisbane and South East Queensland (in-person meetings available)

**Secondary Markets**:

- **Sydney/Melbourne**: Virtual delivery, occasional in-person visits
- **Regional Australia**: Virtual delivery (video calls, Slack, screen sharing)
- **International**: Case-by-case basis (timezone considerations, travel if needed)

**All Services Available Remotely**: While we prefer in-person for kickoffs and training, 100% remote delivery is possible (many clients choose this).
