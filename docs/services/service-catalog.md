## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change my service tier later?

Yes! Most clients start with Starter package, prove value, then expand to Complete or Enterprise. You can also scale down if needs change.

### What if I only need one specific workflow?

We offer custom workflow development starting at $1,000. If you later decide you want more, we can upgrade you to a package and credit the custom work.

### Do you integrate with [specific system]?

We integrate with 100+ systems. If it has an API or supports automation, we can probably integrate it. Ask us about your specific systems.

### What happens after the support period ends?

You have three options:

1. Monthly management ($500-$2K/month) - Most clients choose this
2. Pay-as-you-go consulting ($150-$250/hour) - For occasional needs
3. Self-manage - You own everything, can manage yourself

### Can I manage it myself after implementation?

Yes! You own the workflows and can modify or manage them yourself. We provide complete documentation. Many clients do this initially then come back for monthly management when they realize it's worth the cost.

### What if you integrate with a system and I later switch systems?

We can update integrations for new systems. This is typically $500-$2,000 depending on complexity. Monthly management clients get this included (1 integration per quarter for Professional, unlimited for Enterprise).
